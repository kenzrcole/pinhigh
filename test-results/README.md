Generated by `npm run test:ai`. Each handicap (including EW 2K) is run **100 times** on Lincoln Park; stats are aggregated and routes are recorded.

## Opening in Excel

- **Windows:** Double-click a `.csv` file, or in Excel use **Data → From Text/CSV** and choose the file (UTF-8).
- **Mac:** Open Excel → **File → Open** → select the CSV. If encoding looks wrong, use **File → Import** and pick "CSV" with encoding **UTF-8**.

## Files

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **summary.csv** | One row per handicap: runs, avg/min/max score, fairways %, GIR %, putts/round, up & down % (with min/max for each). |
| **rounds_&lt;handicap&gt;.csv** | One row per round: handicap, run index, total score, then hole_1 … hole_18. |
| **routes_&lt;handicap&gt;.csv** | **Route the AI took:** run, hole, shot_index, lat, lng, distance_yards_to_pin, par, shots_on_hole. Filter by `run` and `hole`, sort by `shot_index` to see the path (tee → … → green). |

## Viewing a route for one hole

1. Open `routes_<handicap>.csv` (e.g. `routes_EW_2K.csv`).
2. Filter **run** = e.g. 1 and **hole** = e.g. 5.
3. Sort by **shot_index** (0 = tee, then each shot to the green).
4. Use **lat** and **lng** to plot the path on a map if desired.
