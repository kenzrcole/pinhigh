### Field of the Invention

The invention relates to computer-implemented systems and methods for simulating a golf player's shot-by-shot performance based on a skill-level parameter (e.g., handicap index), and for calibrating said simulation to published human performance statistics through a batch-testing validation loop.

### Background of the Invention

Golf GPS applications, course-planning tools, and simulated-play engines commonly provide distance information, hole layouts, and sometimes shot-by-shot or round-level simulations keyed to a user’s handicap index. Such systems allow players to visualize holes, plan strategy, or experience a round in software. A persistent technical shortcoming of these conventional systems is that simulated shot outcomes and round scores exhibit **insufficient variance** relative to real play. Shots tend to cluster too tightly around the intended target; scores from repeated simulated rounds show less spread than observed in actual handicap-based play; and aggregate statistics (e.g., greens in regulation, putts per round, scrambling percentage) produced by the simulation often do not match the known statistical distributions for golfers at that handicap level. In other words, the simulation behaves like a player who is too consistent—hitting approach shots with unrealistically low dispersion, making putts at rates that do not reflect handicap, and recovering from missed greens in a way that does not align with published scrambling data. This lack of realistic variance undermines the utility of the simulation for strategy evaluation, course management practice, and any application that relies on round-to-round and shot-to-shot variability (e.g., handicap verification, course difficulty assessment, or training scenarios that require representative good and bad breaks).

The root cause is that conventional implementations typically use **fixed or ad hoc** dispersion and probability parameters. Shot error may be modeled with a single set of standard deviations regardless of skill level, or with simple linear scaling that is not tied to measurable human benchmarks. Putting and short-game outcomes may use generic make/miss curves that do not reflect the strong dependence of real performance on handicap (e.g., three-putt rates and scrambling rates that vary sharply across handicap tiers). Without a **data-driven** link between the handicap index and these parameters, the simulator cannot reproduce the variance and the aggregate statistics that define how golfers at that handicap actually perform.

The present invention addresses this problem by **calibrating the simulation to published human performance data**. A handicap benchmark data structure stores, per handicap tier, real-world statistics such as fairways hit percentage, greens-in-regulation percentage, putts per round, three-putt percentage, and scrambling percentage. A Benchmark-to-Dispersion Mapping System derives Gaussian dispersion parameters (distance and angular standard deviations) and putting/chip probability parameters **from** these benchmarks—e.g., scaling approach-shot dispersion by a greens-in-regulation benchmark and chip dispersion by a scrambling benchmark—so that better benchmark stats yield tighter dispersion and worse stats yield wider dispersion. A Recursive Shot-Selection and Lie-Detection System then uses these parameters at each shot, so that the full round exhibits the appropriate spread of outcomes. A Batch-Test Validation and Calibration System runs many simulated rounds per handicap, aggregates the resulting statistics, and compares them to the same human benchmarks; mapping rules can be adjusted iteratively until simulated variance and aggregate metrics fall within an acceptable range of the benchmarks. In this way, the invention produces **realistic variance** and **data-driven handicap calibration**: shot outcomes and round scores not only reflect the correct average performance for a given handicap but also the correct statistical distribution and spread, as evidenced by alignment with published human performance data.

Block diagram showing the three main subsystems (Benchmark-to-Dispersion Mapping System, Recursive Shot-Selection and Lie-Detection System, Batch-Test Validation and Calibration System), their inputs and outputs, and data flow between them (e.g., handicap index and benchmark table into the Mapping System; dispersion and probability parameters from the Mapping System into the Shot-Selection System; simulated round outcomes from the Shot-Selection System into the Validation System; optional calibration feedback from the Validation System back to the Mapping System).

**FIG. 2** — Benchmark-to-dispersion mapping flowchart. Flow from handicap index input through tier lookup and linear interpolation to the benchmark table; derivation of GIR scaling factor from benchmark GIR; application to base distance and angular dispersion to yield final Gaussian parameters; parallel flows for putting (distance band → base make probability → three-putt scaling → elite cap / plus-handicap blend) and for chip (scrambling benchmark → scrambling multiplier → chip dispersion).

**FIG. 3** — Lie-detection flowchart. Inputs: current ball position, hole feature set (green, fairway(s), bunker(s), water, rough geometry; fairway and optional other greens may be polygons), and optional course boundary. If position outside boundary → out of bounds (penalty/drop). Else decision sequence in priority order: in water? → water; else on green? → green; else in bunker? → bunker; else on fairway? → fairway; else → rough. Single output: discrete lie type (or OB).

**FIG. 4** — Recursive shot-selection decision tree (one iteration). Start with current position; compute distance-to-pin; if within gimme threshold → hole out, end hole. Else run lie detection; if on green and within putt/chip range → putting outcome; if off green and within putt/chip range → chip outcome; if on green and beyond range → putting outcome; if in water → penalty, same position; if in bunker → bunker shot with bunker dispersion; if in rough → full shot to hole with rough multiplier; if on fairway (or default) → target selection (FIG. 5). After shot outcome: optional tree intersection and deflection; if water penalty, retain position; else update position. Loop back to “compute distance-to-pin” for next shot until hole-out or max shots.

**FIG. 5** — Target and distance selection (AI targeting module). Inputs: current position, lie, shot number, hole par, distance-to-pin, fairway geometry. Decision: if first shot, par ≥ 4, distance-to-pin > fairway-target minimum, and fairway center between ball and hole → target = fairway center, intended distance = min(distance to fairway, max shot distance); else → target = hole, intended distance = min(distance-to-pin, max shot distance). Max shot distance from club-distance table by handicap tier. Output: target (point), intended distance.

For each skill level in set (including named reference profiles, e.g. elite, LPGA): run N simulated rounds (seeded RNG); per round record score, fairways hit, GIR, putts, up-and-downs (and optionally per-hole routes). Aggregate over batch: mean, min, max for score, fairways %, GIR %, putts per round, scrambling %. Optional verification sub-loop: run fewer rounds for low vs high handicap; assert high-handicap average score exceeds low by threshold; on failure, trigger recalibration. Recalibration adjusts global parameters (e.g. dispersion scale, chip multiplier) until verification passes; **persist** passing calibration to file/store for runtime load. Export summary (and optionally rounds/routes, PDF reports) to file; compare aggregated metrics to stored human benchmarks; optional feedback path to adjust Benchmark-to-Dispersion Mapping parameters and re-run batch.

### Detailed Description of the Invention

The PinHigh AI engine comprises at least three operatively coupled subsystems: a **Benchmark-to-Dispersion Mapping System**, a **Recursive Shot-Selection and Lie-Detection System**, and a **Batch-Test Validation and Calibration System**. Each is described below.

---

#### 1. Benchmark-to-Dispersion Mapping System

The system maintains a **handicap benchmark data structure** comprising, for each of a plurality of handicap tiers (e.g., 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25), at least the following human-derived statistics: fairways hit percentage, greens-in-regulation (GIR) percentage, putts per eighteen-hole round, three-putt percentage, and scrambling (up-and-down) percentage. Said statistics are sourced from or consistent with published golf performance data (e.g., Arccos, TheGrint, SwingU, Lou Stagner, Break X, Golf Monthly). The structure may further include additional statistics (e.g., GIR+1 chances per round, double-bogey-or-worse percentage) for use in calibration or validation. For a given numeric handicap index (including plus handicaps), the system **resolves** the corresponding benchmark set by mapping the handicap to a tier and, optionally, **linearly interpolating** between adjacent tiers so that non-tier handicaps receive interpolated values (e.g., a handicap of 7 maps between tier 5 and tier 10 with a fractional weight). The plurality of skill levels may also include **named reference profiles** (e.g., an elite or tour-era profile such as “Tiger 2000–era” and a tour-specific profile such as LPGA) in addition to numeric handicap indices; each such profile may have distinct mapping or parameter treatment (e.g., elite putting make probabilities, reduced rough dispersion).

The system **maps said benchmark statistics into parameters of a Gaussian shot-outcome model** as follows.

- **Distance dispersion (standard deviation as a percentage of intended distance):** A base value is computed as a linear function of the handicap index, subject to a minimum floor (e.g., 2% for plus handicaps) and a maximum cap. A **GIR scaling factor** is then applied: the system retrieves the benchmark GIR percentage for that handicap and computes a scale factor as a function of a reference GIR value divided by said benchmark GIR (e.g., 37 / benchmark GIR), clamped to a range (e.g., 1.0 to 1.4). The final distance standard-deviation percentage is the product of the base value and said scale factor, whereby higher benchmark GIR (better players) yields a scale factor at or below 1.0 and lower benchmark GIR (higher handicaps) yields a scale factor above 1.0, so that approach-shot dispersion increases as benchmark GIR decreases.

- **Angular dispersion (standard deviation in degrees):** A base angular standard deviation is computed as a linear function of the handicap index, subject to a minimum floor and maximum cap. The same GIR scaling factor as above is applied to the base angular value to produce the final angular dispersion parameter. Thus both distance and angle components of the Gaussian shot model are **driven by** the stored benchmark GIR for that handicap.

- **Putting make probability:** For each putt, the system converts distance-to-hole to a distance band (e.g., 0–3 ft, 3–5 ft, 5–9 ft, 9–15 ft, 15–25 ft, >25 ft). A **base make probability** per band is defined as a function of handicap (e.g., linear decrease with handicap within each band). A **three-putt scaling factor** is derived from the benchmark three-putt percentage for that handicap (e.g., 1 − (benchmark three-putt % − 6)/100, clamped), and applied to the base probability for longer bands. The resulting probability is **capped** so as not to exceed a reference “elite” putter curve (e.g., Tiger 2000–era make probabilities). For **plus handicaps**, the system may further **blend** the numeric make probability toward said elite curve so that plus-handicap simulated putters perform better than scratch but not better than the elite reference.

- **Chip/short-game dispersion:** When the simulated ball lies off the putting surface and within a short range of the hole (e.g., 20 m), the system treats the shot as a chip. The chip’s dispersion standard deviation is set to the **full-shot** dispersion (from the handicap and GIR mapping above) multiplied by a **scrambling-derived multiplier**. Said multiplier is computed from the benchmark scrambling (up-and-down) percentage for that handicap (e.g., 7.5 + (50 − benchmark scrambling %)/4), so that higher benchmark scrambling (better short game) yields a smaller multiplier and thus tighter chip dispersion, and lower benchmark scrambling yields larger dispersion and fewer successful up-and-downs. For plus handicaps, the system may substitute a pro-level scrambling target (e.g., 50 − 2×handicap, capped) so that plus handicaps exhibit better short-game results than scratch.

The foregoing mapping ensures that the **Gaussian dispersion model** (distance and angle) and the **putting and chipping probability models** are **parameterized by** the same handicap benchmark data structure, so that a single update to the benchmark table propagates to shot outcomes across the simulation.

#### 2. Recursive Shot-Selection and Lie-Detection System

The engine simulates play of a hole by **iteratively** selecting a shot type, a target, and a shot outcome until the ball is within a terminal condition (e.g., within a “gimme” radius of the hole or holed). Each iteration constitutes one “shot” and updates the ball position. The selection logic is **conditional on (a) the current ball position, (b) the lie at that position, and (c) the distance from the ball to the hole (pin)**.

**Lie detection:** A **lie-detection module** receives the current ball position (e.g., latitude/longitude or Cartesian coordinates) and a **hole feature set** comprising geometric definitions of the green, fairway(s), bunker(s), water hazard(s), and rough (e.g., circles or polygons with centers and radii). The hole feature set may include **polygon definitions** for fairway and optionally other greens (e.g., adjacent holes); lie is determined by containment in said regions. The module determines the lie by testing containment of the ball position in said regions in a **priority order** (e.g., water, then green, then bunker, then fairway, then rough). The output is a discrete lie type: e.g., green, water, bunker, fairway, or rough. The system may further define a **course boundary** (e.g., polygon); a ball position **outside** said boundary may be treated as **out of bounds**, with a penalty applied and position updated (e.g., drop) before the next iteration.

**Distance-to-pin:** The system computes the **distance from the current ball position to the hole (pin)** using a geodetic or Euclidean distance function (e.g., Haversine for WGS84 coordinates).

**Terminal condition:** If the distance-to-pin is less than a **gimme threshold** (e.g., 6 inches), the system records a holed outcome and terminates the hole.

**Shot-type and target selection (recursive logic):**

- **Within a short putt/chip range (e.g., ≤ 20 m) and on the putting surface:** The system invokes a **putting outcome module** that uses the distance-based make probability (from the Benchmark-to-Dispersion Mapping System) and, if the putt is missed, samples a leave position (e.g., 1–3 ft from the hole in a random direction). No Gaussian full-shot dispersion is applied; the outcome is binary (holed or not) plus leave position. The ball position is updated to the hole (if holed) or the leave position; the iteration continues or terminates accordingly.

- **Within the short range but not on the putting surface (e.g., chip):** The system invokes a **chip shot outcome** using the chip dispersion parameters (scrambling-derived multiplier applied to the handicap-based dispersion). The target is the hole. A Gaussian outcome (distance and angle error) is applied with said chip dispersion and an optional maximum shot length (e.g., putter max). The ball position is updated to the landing position; the next iteration will again evaluate lie and distance (e.g., may then be on the green and trigger putting logic).

- **On the putting surface but beyond the short range:** The same putting outcome module is used (distance-based make probability, leave position on miss). Ball position is updated; iteration continues.

- **In a water hazard:** The system records the shot, applies a **penalty stroke**, and leaves the ball position unchanged (or at a drop position per rules). The next iteration re-evaluates from the same or updated position.

- **In a bunker:** The system sets the target to the hole and applies a **bunker-specific dispersion** (e.g., higher standard-deviation percentage and a maximum shot length) independent of the full-shot Gaussian parameters. Outcome is computed via the same Gaussian model with these overrides. Ball position is updated to the landing position; **lie detection is then run on the landing position** to determine the next shot type (e.g., may land on green and then use putting on the next iteration).

- **In rough:** The system sets the target to the hole and applies a **rough multiplier** to the handicap-based dispersion (e.g., increased distance and angular dispersion) and, optionally, a distance multiplier (e.g., reduced max distance). Outcome is computed; ball position is updated; lie is re-evaluated at the new position.

- **On fairway (or default):** If the current shot number is one (tee shot), the hole par is at least four, the distance-to-pin exceeds a **fairway-target minimum** (e.g., 180 m), and the hole feature set includes at least one fairway region whose center lies between the ball and the hole, the system sets the **target** to the **fairway center** (or first fairway region) and the intended distance to the minimum of (distance to fairway center, maximum shot distance for that handicap). Otherwise, the target is set to the **hole** and the intended distance to the minimum of (distance-to-pin, maximum shot distance for that handicap). The **maximum shot distance** is obtained from a club-distance table keyed by handicap tier (e.g., HackMotion-derived or similar), so that the simulated player cannot exceed realistic carry distances for their skill level. The system then invokes the **Gaussian shot-outcome module** with the handicap-derived distance and angular standard deviations (and no override), producing a landing position. **Tree obstacles**, if present, may be tested for segment intersection with the shot path; if the ball path intersects a tree and the ball height at that point does not clear the tree height, a **deflection** is applied (e.g., new landing position near the impact point with a random deflection direction and distance). The ball position is updated to the landing position (or deflected position); **lie detection is run on the new position** (e.g., may be in water, bunker, fairway, or rough). The next iteration then repeats the same logic from the new position and lie.

**Environmental conditions:** The system may accept **environmental inputs** (e.g., wind speed and direction, slope or elevation) and compute an **effective (condition-adjusted) yardage** for target and club selection. When such inputs are provided, the shot-selection and club-distance logic uses said effective yardage so that the simulated player plays under the same conditions as displayed to the user (e.g., wind and slope applied consistently to both display and AI).

**Iteration and termination:** The foregoing steps are repeated in a loop until either (i) the ball is within the gimme threshold (or holed), or (ii) a maximum shot count (e.g., 20) is reached. The sequence of (position, target, shot type, outcome) for each iteration constitutes the **shot history** for the hole.

Thus the **recursive shot-selection logic** is **lie-dependent** and **distance-dependent**: lie determines whether putting, chipping, bunker, rough, or full-shot logic is used, and distance-to-pin and shot number determine target (fairway vs. hole) and whether the short-range putt/chip branch is taken. The Gaussian dispersion parameters (and any overrides for bunker, rough, or chip) are supplied by the Benchmark-to-Dispersion Mapping System so that the entire shot sequence is **calibrated to** the same handicap benchmark data.

#### 3. Batch-Test Validation and Calibration System

The engine includes a **validation and calibration system** that (a) runs a **batch of simulated rounds** for each of a plurality of skill levels (e.g., a reference “elite” profile and a set of numeric handicap indices), (b) **aggregates** per-round statistics (total score, fairways hit, greens in regulation, total putts, up-and-down success) over the batch, and (c) **outputs** summary statistics (e.g., mean, minimum, maximum) and, optionally, **exports** them to a structured data format (e.g., CSV) for comparison against the **same human benchmark statistics** used to parameterize the Benchmark-to-Dispersion Mapping System.

**Batch execution:** For each skill level in a predefined set, the system runs a **fixed number** of independent simulated eighteen-hole rounds (e.g., 100 rounds per skill level). Each round uses a **deterministic or seeded random number generator** so that runs are reproducible. For each round, the system simulates every hole (e.g., 18 holes) using the Recursive Shot-Selection and Lie-Detection System, from tee position to hole-out, and records per-hole outcomes (strokes, fairway hit yes/no, green in regulation yes/no, putts, up-and-down success when applicable) and, optionally, the **sequence of ball positions** (route) for each hole.

**Aggregation:** For each skill level, the system aggregates over the batch: total score (sum of strokes across holes and rounds), fairways hit count and fairway opportunities (e.g., par-4 and par-5 tee shots), greens in regulation count, total putts, and up-and-down count and opportunities (e.g., holes where GIR was missed but the ball was eventually on the green). From these it computes **derived metrics**: e.g., average score per round, fairways hit percentage, GIR percentage, putts per eighteen-hole round, and up-and-down (scrambling) percentage. The system may also compute **min and max** over the batch for each metric (e.g., min and max score, min and max GIR percentage) to characterize variance.

**Verification sub-loop:** Optionally, before or as part of the batch, the system runs a **handicap verification** in which it runs a smaller number of rounds (e.g., 30) each for a low handicap (e.g., 5) and a high handicap (e.g., 20) and checks that the **average score** for the high handicap exceeds the average score for the low handicap by at least a threshold (e.g., 10 strokes). If the check fails, the system may report a failure and/or trigger a recalibration of the Benchmark-to-Dispersion Mapping System (e.g., adjusting the base dispersion formula or the GIR scaling factor) so that the simulated skill ordering matches expectations.

**Export and comparison:** The system writes the aggregated summary (and optionally per-round and per-shot route data) to one or more output files (e.g., CSV). The system may also produce **human-readable reports** (e.g., PDF) including per-profile statistics and, optionally, course maps with shot paths. A user or an automated process may **compare** the simulated summary statistics to the **stored human benchmark statistics** (e.g., the same handicap tiers in the handicap benchmark data structure). **Calibration** is achieved by iteratively adjusting the mapping rules (e.g., the linear coefficients in the base dispersion formula, the GIR scale factor bounds, or the scrambling multiplier formula) and re-running the batch until the simulated metrics fall within an acceptable range of the benchmark values. The system may **persist** calibration parameters (e.g., global dispersion scale and chip multiplier) to a file or store; the shot-selection system may **load** said parameters at runtime so that gameplay uses the calibrated baseline until the next batch run. Recalibration may adjust said parameters (e.g., scaling dispersion and chip difficulty up or down) until verification passes, then write the passing calibration for runtime use. Thus the **validation loop** closes the loop: human benchmarks → mapping system → shot outcomes → batch aggregation → comparison to human benchmarks → adjustment of mapping system (and optionally persisted calibration).

### Summary of Technical Contributions

1. **Benchmark-to-dispersion mapping:** A single handicap-indexed benchmark table (GIR %, putts per round, 3-putt %, scrambling %, etc.) drives both **Gaussian dispersion parameters** (distance and angle) and **putting/chip probability parameters**, with GIR used to scale dispersion and 3-putt and scrambling used to scale putting and chip dispersion, so that simulated aggregate stats trend toward the benchmarks. Named reference profiles (e.g., elite/tour-era, LPGA) may receive distinct parameter treatment.

2. **Recursive, lie- and distance-driven shot selection:** Each shot type (putt, chip, bunker, rough, full shot) and target (fairway vs. hole) is selected **recursively** based on the **current lie** (from a geometric lie-detection step that may use polygons for fairway and optional other greens, and that may treat out-of-bounds via a course boundary) and **distance-to-pin**, with optional tree collision and water penalty handling, and with all dispersion parameters supplied by the benchmark-mapping system. The system may accept environmental inputs (wind, slope) and use effective yardage so the simulated player plays under the same conditions as the user.

3. **Batch-test validation loop:** A batch of many simulated rounds per skill level is run, aggregated to summary statistics (and optionally min/max and route data), and exported (e.g., CSV and optionally PDF reports) for comparison to the same benchmarks that parameterize the mapping system. Calibration parameters may be persisted (e.g., to a file) and loaded at runtime so gameplay uses the calibrated baseline until the next batch run, enabling iterative calibration of the AI engine to human performance data.
