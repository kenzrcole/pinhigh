# Building in the Weeds

I’m starting this Substack to share the journey of building something new in golf tech—without giving away the recipe.

---

**The short version:** I’m building a product that sits at the intersection of golf, data, and how players and courses make decisions. It’s early, it’s messy, and it’s the most focused I’ve been in a long time.

**The slightly longer version:** Golf is full of decisions—club choice, target, risk vs. reward—but most of us don’t have a clear picture of how those decisions play out across different skill levels, conditions, or courses. I saw a gap between the data that *could* exist and what players and operators actually get. So I started building toward that gap: tools that help people see patterns, compare scenarios, and make better choices, whether you’re a weekend player or someone running a facility.

The value isn’t in one feature. It’s in turning scattered information into something you can use—without needing to be a data scientist or a pro. That’s the north star.

I’m not going to spell out the exact product yet, or how it works under the hood. Some of that is still taking shape; some of it I’m protecting. What I will share here is the *why*—who it’s for, what problems I care about, and what I’m learning as I go. Think of this as the build-in-public part of the story, not the spec sheet.

If you’re into golf, product, or the messy middle of building something from zero, I’d be glad to have you along.
