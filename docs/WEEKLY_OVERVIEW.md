# PinHigh — Weekly overview (for Monday report)

The weekly report uses this file for the **high-level overview** (what was created, built, updated, tested). Add a section for each week; the report uses the section whose heading matches **Week of YYYY-MM-DD – YYYY-MM-DD**.

You can paste or type what was done (e.g. from Cursor Agent, notes, or a quick list). If no section exists for the week, the report falls back to **recently modified files** (last 7 days under `src/`, `scripts/`, `docs/`).
